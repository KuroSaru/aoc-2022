# aoc-2022

My attempts at aoc 2022.
Each challange is solved in C then ASM

Ive tried to give myself the following restrictions:
- SYSCALLs only where possible.
- No built in C functions (printf etc..)
- Limit Stack Usage
- ASM must output same as C

Is this a dumnb idea? yes but it is also fun.

Challanges:
	1: [ASM](../blob/master/1/aoc.s) / [C](../blob/master/1/aoc-v.c)
	2: [ASM](../blob/master/2/aoc.s) / [C](../blob/master/2/aoc-v.c)
